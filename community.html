        Reading good books together. We thrive on a like minded community of readers here at Book Haven, and we encourage
        all our customers to come spend time together. We do monthly voting to see what book we will add to the book club
        list next and bring our community together to have coffee and book discussion on Thursday evening after closing
        time from 6 pm - 9 pm. We love to have new members come and join our community. Come on and lets all get lost in
        the stories together
