# BookHavenBookstore
website for BookHavenBookstore


Full code for the Book Haven Bookstore project. I used vs code to do this instead of stackBlitz, because i am more familiar with vs code since I already use it at work. 

After doing final work through of my app.js file i went through it again and did better job spaceing it and making it's readability for future state easier.
